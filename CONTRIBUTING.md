Please post any questions, suggestions, descriptions of traps as [issues].
Mention known references to *Microsoft Connect*, *Stack Overflow*, and etc.

Pull requests are welcome. Ideally, they should follow the common pattern:

- A directory with a distinctive name related to one issue.
- *README.md* describes the issue and demo scripts.
- One or more scripts demonstrating the issue.
- *.test.ps1* is a good addition.

Accepted pull requests may be revised, perhaps completely reworked.
